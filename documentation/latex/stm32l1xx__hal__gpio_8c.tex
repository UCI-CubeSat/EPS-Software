                  ##### GPIO Peripheral features #####
==============================================================================         
[..] 
Each port bit of the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) ports can be individually 
configured by software in several modes:
(+) Input mode 
(+) Analog mode
(+) Output mode
(+) Alternate function mode
(+) External interrupt/event lines

[..]  
During and just after reset, the alternate functions and external interrupt  
lines are not active and the I/O ports are configured in input floating mode.

[..]   
All GPIO pins have weak internal pull-up and pull-down resistors, which can be 
activated or not.

[..]
In Output or Alternate mode, each IO can be configured on open-drain or push-pull
type and the IO speed can be selected depending on the VDD value.

[..]
The microcontroller IO pins are connected to onboard peripherals/modules through a 
multiplexer that allows only one peripheral s alternate function (AF) connected 
to an IO pin at a time. In this way, there can be no conflict between peripherals 
sharing the same IO pin. 

[..]  
All ports have external interrupt/event capability. To use external interrupt 
lines, the port must be configured in input mode. All available GPIO pins are 
connected to the 16 external interrupt/event lines from EXTI0 to EXTI15.

[..]  
The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 28 edge detectors 
(depending on products 16 lines are connected to GPIO) for generating event/interrupt
requests (each input line can be independently configured to select the type 
(interrupt or event) and the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both). 
Each line can also be masked independently. 
 
          ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================  
[..]
 (#) Enable the GPIO AHB clock using the following function : __GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE(). 
                                  
 (#) Configure the GPIO pin(s) using HAL_GPIO_Init().
     (++) Configure the IO mode using "Mode" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
     (++) Activate Pull-up, Pull-down resistor using "Pull" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef 
          structure.
     (++) In case of Output or alternate function mode selection: the speed is 
          configured through "Speed" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure, 
          the speed is configurable: Low, Medium and High.
     (++) If alternate mode is selected, the alternate function connected to the IO
          is configured through "Alternate" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
     (++) Analog mode is required when a pin is to be used as ADC channel 
          or DAC output.
     (++) In case of external interrupt/event selection the "Mode" member from 
          GPIO_InitTypeDef structure select the type (interrupt or event) and 
          the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both).

 (#) In case of external interrupt/event mode selection, configure NVIC IRQ priority 
     mapped to the EXTI line using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and enable it using
     HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().

 (#) HAL_GPIO_DeInit allows to set register values to their reset value. It's also 
     recommended to use it to unconfigure pin which was used as an external interrupt 
     or in event mode. That's the only way to reset corresponding bit in EXTI & SYSCFG 
     registers.

 (#) To get the level of a pin configured in input mode use HAL_GPIO_ReadPin().

 (#) To set/reset the level of a pin configured in output mode use 
     HAL_GPIO_WritePin()/HAL_GPIO_TogglePin().

 (#) To lock pin configuration until next reset use HAL_GPIO_LockPin().

 (#) During and just after reset, the alternate functions are not 
     active and the GPIO pins are configured in input floating mode (except JTAG
     pins).

 (#) The LSE oscillator pins OSC32_IN and OSC32_OUT can be used as general purpose 
     (PC14 and PC15, respectively) when the LSE oscillator is off. The LSE has 
     priority over the GPIO function.

 (#) The HSE oscillator pins OSC_IN/OSC_OUT can be used as 
     general purpose PH0 and PH1, respectively, when the HSE oscillator is off. 
     The HSE has priority over the GPIO function.\end{DoxyVerb}
