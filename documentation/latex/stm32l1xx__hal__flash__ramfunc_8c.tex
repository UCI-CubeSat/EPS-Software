    --------------------
    [..] RAM functions are defined using the toolchain options. 
         Functions that are be executed in RAM should reside in a separate
         source module. Using the 'Options for File' dialog you can simply change
         the 'Code / Const' area of a module to a memory space in physical RAM.
         Available memory areas are declared in the 'Target' tab of the 
         Options for Target' dialog.

    *** ICCARM Compiler ***
    -----------------------
    [..] RAM functions are defined using a specific toolchain keyword "__ramfunc".

    *** GNU Compiler ***
    --------------------
    [..] RAM functions are defined using a specific toolchain attribute
         "__attribute__((section(".RamFunc")))".\end{DoxyVerb}
